## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to create a professional and engaging portfolio for Cocker & Co. The website includes sections on our services, the benefits of working with us, customer testimonials, and a footer packed with company info and resources.

## Process and Challenges

### Process
1. **Planning**: I started with a solid plan, outlining the structure, content, and design of the website. Identifying the key sections and ensuring a smooth flow of information was crucial.
2. **Design**: Next, I focused on creating a visually appealing design that aligns with our brand. I used Bootstrap for responsiveness and added custom CSS for unique styling.
3. **Development**: This phase involved coding the site with HTML and CSS. I prioritized making the site responsive and accessible.
4. **Testing**: I conducted extensive testing to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices, and to make sure our site is accessible to everyone.

### Challenges
1. **Accessibility**: Ensuring the site is accessible was a significant challenge. I added features like a "Skip to main content" link, alt text for images, and ARIA attributes for better screen reader navigation.
2. **Responsive Design**: Making the site look good and function well on all devices required careful planning and testing. I relied on Bootstrap's grid system to achieve this.
3. **Content Organization**: Structuring the content to be easy to navigate and engaging was tricky. I overcame this by using a clear, logical layout with well-defined sections and navigation links.

## Learnings

Creating this portfolio was a great learning experience.
1. **Responsive Design Techniques**: I reinforced our understanding of designing for various screen sizes and devices. Working with Bootstrap and custom CSS taught us a lot.
2. **Content Strategy**: Organizing and presenting content effectively is vital. I learned how to structure content to engage users and convey our message clearly.

## Assets and Resources

Here's a list of the assets and resources we used:

1. **Frameworks and Libraries**:
   - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For responsive design and UI components.
   - [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) - For icons in the footer.

2. **Fonts**:
   - [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) - The primary font used throughout the site.

3. **Images**:
   - Logo and various images created in-house.
   - Placeholder user images for testimonials.

4. **Other**:
